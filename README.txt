Hesse Center Class Tutoring Availability Project

This system is designed to take two input .csv files from the script's directory -- one detailing the 
shifts each tutor works (Input Data/Tutor Shifts.csv) and one detailing the classes each tutor is
comfortable tutoring. Both files should be saved to the 'Input Data' directory.

The system will then generate an output of a multitude of .html files, one for each covered course.
These files can be found in the 'HTML Output' directory.


To execute the script, simply click on the 'run.bat' file located in this directory.
